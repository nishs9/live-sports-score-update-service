# live-sports-score-update-service

## Description

This is a set of python scripts that are used to update a Redis database with live NFL and MLB scores. it is one component of a project I have worked on using an Adafruit Matrix Portal.

The intention is that these scripts can be integrated with any cron job framework to keep a Redis DB (or any DB for that matter) updated with live scores from the NFL and MLB. For my project, these scripts are being deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 and using the built-in crontab tool.
